This repository hosts Inception, a project from the common core curriculum of 42 School.

The objective of this project is to create a virtual environment using Docker and Docker Compose that will make a WordPress website accessible. Nginx, WordPress with PHP-FPM, and MariaDB need to be running in three separate containers, each communicating with the others.

The project aims to teach the containerization of services and how the different components of a classic website (server, website, database) work together. As the project had to be defended on a virtual machine (I used VirtualBox), it was also an opportunity to work on system administration and shell scripting.

If you're a 42 student and you're passing by, don't hesitate to take a look but don't copy paste it (as you would lose the opportunity to learn and may reproduce some of my code's flaws).
